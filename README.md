# DATA_70600_final
## Course Description
This class is an exploration of JavaScript designed for those who may not have much experience with
programming languages. Together we will read a book about JavaScript and do the work of that book,
thereby learning about JavaScript syntax and a few of the more popular libraries.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the semester, successful students will
<ul>
<li>Gain capacity to read and write JavaScript at a beginner level</li>
<li>Be familiar with JS libraries like Leaflet and JQuery</li>
<li>Create a small project of their own that can live on the web!</li>
<li>Be ready for further classes that require JavaScript knowledge</li>
</ul> 

## Project Requirements
Your projects should demonstrate that you understand the major concepts covered in this course. At a baseline level, this means your project should include:
<ul>
<li>A homepage that includes a brief description of your project and its purpose.</li>
<li>Interactive content that allows the user to explore the project (buttons, links, images, text, etc).</li>
<li>Dataset(s) pertinent to the project, whether it be data you've created yourself, or data you've imported from a data source.</li>
<li>Some sort of visualization of the data you are working with (e.g., a map).</li>
<li>A style appropriate to the project or to your personal aesthetic tastes.</li>
<li>A new GitHub repository dedicated to the project and a working version that you can share with others.</li>
<li>Depending on the kind of project you are creating, it might be weighted towards one or more of these requirements over the others. This is fine, as long as you are, again, able to show that you understand the material we've covered.</li>
</ul>

## Final Project

This Leaflet-based web map illustrates how climate change will disproportionately affect residents of New York City's public housing as sea levels continue to rise. By the 2050's, a significant amount of NYCHA public housing developments will be in projected flood zones impacted by hazardous 100-year floods. Consequently, this will likely adversely affect New Yorkers belonging to lower socio-economic brackets who are already at a heightened risk of homelessness and housing insecurity.
