This Leaflet-based web map illustrates how climate change will disproportionately affect residents of New York City's public housing as sea levels continue to rise. By the 2050's, a significant amount of NYCHA public housing developments will be in projected flood zones impacted by hazardous 100-year floods. Consequently, this will likely adversely affect New Yorkers belonging to lower socio-economic brackets who are already at a heightened risk of homelessness and housing insecurity.
