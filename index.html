            <p><b>This map illustrates how climate change will disproportionately affect residents of New York City's public housing as sea levels continue to rise.</b> By the 2050's, a significant amount of NYCHA public housing developments will be in projected
                flood zones impacted by hazardous 100-year floods. Consequently, this will likely adversely affect New Yorkers belonging to lower socio-economic brackets who are already at a heightened risk of homelessness and housing insecurity.</p>

            <b> 100-year flood</b> "The primary design standard for coastal flooding and storm surge in the United States is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) defined 100-year flood, also known as the 1 percent annual chance flood. The 100-year
            flood is defined as a flood that has a 1 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. For nearly 40 years, the 100-year flood zone has been considered a high risk flooding area and subject to special building codes, and insurance and environmental regulations." <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/assets/1B434B8A-CE35-41F5-B827-E8360AF2A6A8?download=true">(New York City Panel on Climate Change, Climate Risk Information 2013, Observations, Climate Change, Projections, and Maps.
